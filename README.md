# Implementation of the RRT Algorithm For Motion Planning
Source code for the implementation of the RRT Algorithm. Written for an assignment/project, for the Johns Hopkins University Course Algorithms For Sensor-Based Robotics, Fall 2024.
To summarize, a class was implemented, with member functions and member variables defined to implement the logic of RRT. The environment/simulation setup that calls this class was provided by the instructor and is not included in this repository. 

Navigate to src/assignment3_context.cpp and src/assignment3_context.h to see the code written for this project. In src/assignment3_context.cpp, functions written by myself have the comment "/* Self-Written Method */" above the function definition. In src/assignment3_context.h, I defined a tree data structure called NAry_Tree to help with traversing between nodes in the tree. 

A video demonstration of this motion planning can be found at my portfolio (https://bchien21.github.io/chienbrian-portfolio/). Navigate to the projects tab, and select the RRT project.
